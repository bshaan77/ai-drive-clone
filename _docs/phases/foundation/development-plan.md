# Development Plan: 3-4 Day Google Drive Clone

**Total Duration**: 3-4 days (12-16 hours)  
**Goal**: Build a functional Google Drive clone using V0 for rapid UI development

## Phase Overview

### Day 1: Foundation (3-4 hours)

**Phase 1: Project Setup**

- Initialize Next.js with T3 stack
- Set up authentication (Clerk)
- Configure database (Neon PostgreSQL)
- Create basic layout with V0
- Set up file storage (Vercel Blob)

### Day 2: Core Features (6-8 hours)

**Phase 2: File Upload & Display**

- Drag-and-drop file upload
- File grid/list display
- File operations (download, rename, delete)
- Folder creation and navigation

**Phase 3: Search & Sharing**

- Real-time search functionality
- File sharing with users
- Public link sharing
- Shared files view

### Day 3: Polish & Deploy (3-4 hours)

**Phase 4: Polish & Essential Features**

- UI polish and responsiveness
- File preview capabilities
- Dashboard and analytics
- Notifications and feedback
- Production deployment

## Key Features Included

✅ **File Management**: Upload, download, organize, delete  
✅ **Folder System**: Create, navigate, hierarchical structure  
✅ **Search**: Real-time search with filters  
✅ **Sharing**: User-to-user and public links  
✅ **Authentication**: Secure sign-in/sign-up  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach  
✅ **File Preview**: Basic preview for common file types  
✅ **Dashboard**: Storage usage and recent files

## Features Removed for Speed

❌ **Real-time Collaboration**: Too complex for 3-4 days  
❌ **Advanced AI Features**: Can be added later  
❌ **File Versioning**: Nice-to-have but not essential  
❌ **Bulk Operations**: Can be simplified  
❌ **Advanced Analytics**: Basic dashboard is sufficient

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: V0 for rapid scaffolding, Shadcn/ui

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **User Testing**: Get feedback from target users
2. **Performance Optimization**: Improve loading times
3. **AI Features**: Add intelligent search and organization
4. **Advanced Features**: Real-time collaboration, versioning
5. **Mobile App**: Consider React Native app

This plan focuses on delivering a solid MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of Google Drive while keeping development time to 3-4 days maximum.
