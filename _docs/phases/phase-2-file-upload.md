## ✅ Step 2: Folder Navigation

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**What we implemented:**

- [x] Click folder to navigate into it
- [x] Update current folder state
- [x] Fetch and display files/folders for the selected folder
- [x] Update breadcrumbs to show current path

**Key Features:**

- **Dynamic Breadcrumbs**: Shows the full path from root to current folder
- **Clickable Navigation**: Click any breadcrumb to navigate to that folder
- **Folder Filtering**: Files API now supports `folderId` parameter to filter files by folder
- **State Management**: Proper state updates when navigating between folders
- **Selection Clearing**: File selection is cleared when navigating to prevent confusion

**API Changes:**

- **Files API**: Added `folderId` query parameter support with proper null handling
- **Folders API**: Added single folder retrieval endpoint for breadcrumb building

**Testing Steps:**

1. Create a folder in the root directory
2. Click on the folder to navigate into it
3. Verify breadcrumbs show "My Drive > [Folder Name]"
4. Click "My Drive" in breadcrumbs to return to root
5. Create a subfolder inside the first folder
6. Navigate into the subfolder and verify breadcrumbs show full path
7. Click any breadcrumb to navigate to that level
